/**
 * Fill + shadow for the selected cell of a segmented control — the thumb that
 * sits proud of a recessed track. Shared by the shader tabs and the appearance
 * toggle so the two can't drift apart.
 *
 * Four steps above the substrate, not one, because the thing to clear is the
 * track, not the bar. The track is a 6% white wash over the substrate, which in
 * dark mode lifts it further than a single surface step does — at +1 the
 * "raised" cell came out *darker* than the recess around it, and the only thing
 * still reading as a thumb was the ring. Fill first, outline second.
 *
 * Fill only — none of SURFACE_SHADOW's levels work here, because every one of
 * them carries a `0 0 0 1px` ring, and a ring on a cell that butts its
 * neighbours reads as a border drawn around the selection rather than as the
 * selection sitting proud of the track. What lifts a thumb out of a recess is
 * the contact shadow under it, so keep that layer and drop the ring.
 *
 * Two drop layers, not one. Strength follows the surface ladder's own
 * progression — `0 3px 3px -1.5px` is exactly the layer separating --shadow-2
 * from --shadow-3 — rather than a heavier alpha, so the cell stays on the same
 * shadow system as everything else. Both spreads stay negative, which keeps the
 * shadow tucked under the cell: a thumb resting on the track, not floating.
 *
 * Dark also keeps a top bevel: on a dark track the fill alone is a small step,
 * and the inset highlight is what says "top edge" without outlining the shape.
