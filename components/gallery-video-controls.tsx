 * the curves — a scrim at the foot of the frame, a 2px track that thickens to
 * 3px under the cursor, a thumb that is only there while you are pointing at it.
 * Its close, mute and fullscreen buttons did not come with it: the gallery has
 * its own close, and a canvas recording has no audio track to mute (see
 * lib/video-capture.ts, where the stream is the canvas and nothing else).
 *
 * White on a scrim in both themes, which is the one place this app does not
 * answer to the appearance toggle. The bar sits over the artwork, and the
 * artwork can be any brightness — the same argument CaptureBadge makes for its
 * own scrim.
 *
 * **It does not contain the `<video>`.** That lives inside the gallery's morph
 * card; this lives in the chrome layer with the close and delete buttons, and
 * the two are joined by useRecordingPlayback. See that hook for why.
