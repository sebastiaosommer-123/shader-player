/**
 * What a toast looks like. Where it goes and how long it stays is set at the
 * call site in app/layout.tsx.
 *
 * Everything here is aimed at one thing: a toast should read as the same
 * furniture as the floating toolbar, because it is the same kind of object — a
 * small raised panel over the artwork. The bar is `Elevated offset={2}
 * shadowLevel={3}`, which resolves to bg-surface-3 + shadow-surface-3, so those
 * are the two tokens matched below.

          // gives that box `margin-left: -3px`. So the inset the eye reads is
          // paddingLeft + that margin, and 15 - 3 lands the disc at 12px.

          // holds whatever the corner radius is: the disc is vertically centred,

          //
          // This was 12px on the theory that the icon carries optical bearing
          // and should sit tighter. That is a rule for letterforms; a filled
          // disc has no bearing to give back, so it read short of its own
          // vertical gap.
