/**
 * The mobile frame: 41×52, which is a 33×44 picture at 3:4.

 *
 * *Upright*, because the 92-wide landscape box this replaced showed 40% of a
 * phone-shaped capture. `object-cover` scales to fill the width, so a portrait
 * wallpaper in a 1.44 box loses its top and bottom — most of what makes it
 * recognisable as that capture — at the one size where there is least to go on.
 * At 3:4 the frame keeps 77%.
 *
 * *Uniform*, and not the capture's own aspect, which is what this was for about
 * an hour. Every capture here is the canvas, and the canvas is the screen, so
 * sizing each frame to its source produces no variety at all: just a rank of
 * identical 40px slivers, a barcode rather than a filmstrip. Aspect fidelity is
 * the one-up view's job — it is showing the whole capture, full bleed, directly
 * above this. The rail is a scrubber, and an even pitch is what makes it
 * scannable. It is also what iOS does everywhere: the Photos grid is square and
 * centre-cropped whatever the shot, and its one-up filmstrip is uniform tiles
 * with the current one *marked*, not resized.
 *
 * *Cropped* at 3:4 rather than square — the iOS convention tilted portrait,
 * since every capture here is. Square would read as a photo library; this reads
 * as a stack of wallpapers, which is what they are.
 *
 * 41 wide rather than the 39 a 3:4 *frame* would be: the 2px button border and
 * the 2px of selection-ring padding take 4px off each edge, and it is the
 * picture that has to be 3:4, since the picture is the part anyone looks at.
 *
 * That lands the frame at 52 tall and 41 wide — over the 44px minimum touch
 * target on one axis and 3px under it on the other, which is as close as a 3:4
 * box gets without the picture driving the width somewhere it should not go.
 * The shortfall is also bounded by the rail being a convenience rather than the
 * only way through the stack: the gallery pages with a swipe across the
 * full-screen image, which is a target the size of the screen.
 *
 * The desktop rail keeps its own 80×56: that pitch is what the magnification
 * field's fit and geometry are reckoned off.
