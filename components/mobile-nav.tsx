   * one reason to leave now — the controls panel taking the screen, and a recording
   * starting — and a bar with two different exits reads as two bars. The scale
   * is what keeps it from being a light switch: nothing here vanishes from full
   * size, it withdraws. Dropped under reduced motion, where the fade alone still
   * carries the change.
   *
   * cubic-bezier(0.23, 1, 0.32, 1) is a hard ease-out — most of the distance is
   * covered in the first third — so the control is perceptually gone well before
   * the 180ms is up, and the shutter has the moment to itself.
   *
   * Nothing reflows on the way out. Every slot in the row is fixed width, so the
   * controls go from their places rather than the row closing over them, and
   * they come back to the same pixels.
   *
   * **Leaving is immediate; coming back waits.** The delay is one-directional
   * and it is the same number whatever put the control away, because the rule is
   * about the bar rather than about the reason: the bar is the destination, so
   * it is the last thing to arrive. Concretely it stops the controls fading up
   * underneath a controls panel that is still fading down — two crossfading
   * planes in the same place — and when a recording ends instead, the beat reads
   * as the clip resolving rather than as lag.
