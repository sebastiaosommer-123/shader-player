/**
 * The capture you just deleted, leaving.
 *
 * A plain <img> that recedes to 0.8 and fades — a standard exit, not an effect.
 * It replaces a 1.5s WebGL burn and then a 280ms particle dispersal, both of
 * which were ceremony on what is a janitorial action, and neither of which
 * suited the material: a dispersal needs edges to read as fragments, and a soft
 * gradient has none, so it came apart into static rather than pieces.
 *
 * Only ever half of a delete. The other half — the capture before it sliding
 * across to take the slot — is drawn by the gallery itself, which is the only
 * place that knows where the strip is. This one is pinned to the rect the
 * deleted capture occupied and does not travel with it: the picture leaving and
 * the picture arriving are two events, and giving them the same motion would
 * make them one.
 *
 * The deletion itself commits on the press, before either of them starts.
 *
 * Rendered at the app root rather than inside the gallery, which is the only
 * reason it needs a module-level channel at all: deleting the *last* capture
 * closes the gallery on the press frame, and an exit mounted inside that
 * subtree would be torn down before it drew.
