/**
 * Ring, gap, fill — the shutter every camera app draws, at the two sizes this
 * app needs it.
 *
 * The proportions are not shared between them and should not be: the desktop
 * shutter sits in the floating bar next to a 44px thumbnail slot and two 44px
 * tab tracks and has to line up with all of them (SLOT_SIZE in
 * lib/toolbar-geometry.ts, SIZES in segmented-tabs.tsx), while the mobile one
 * owns its own row and is sized for a thumb.
 * What *is* shared is the relationship — a ring deliberately heavier than the
 * gap it encloses, because at low contrast a thin ring plus a wide gap reads as
 * two concentric shapes rather than as one shutter.
 *
 * `fill` is written out rather than derived, so the arithmetic is checkable at a
 * glance: 44 − 2×2.5 − 2×1.5 = 36, and 68 − 2×4 − 2×2 = 56. The ring and its gap
 * are the numbers held fixed when the bar's unit changed, not the fill — they are
 * the two that read as weights rather than as size, and thinning either to keep a
 * rounder fill is what turns the shutter back into two concentric shapes.
 *
 * `stop` is the rounded square the fill becomes while recording — the universal
 * stop glyph, at the fraction of the fill that reads as "the same control in a
 * different state" rather than as a new one.

/**
 * The shutter.
 *
 * One component for both bars, unified on `--shutter-ink`. That token resolves
 * to `var(--foreground)` in dark (app/globals.css) and the mobile bar is pinned
 * dark at every width, so the mobile shutter is pixel-identical to the
 * hardcoded `border-foreground` it replaced; only the light desktop shutter
 * takes the token's deliberate pullback from full-strength ink.
 *
 * **The press scales the fill, not the button.** On a real camera the ring is
 * part of the body and only the button travels; scaling both would read as the
 * whole shutter assembly shrinking into the bar.
 *
 * Ring and fill are both `currentColor`, which is what keeps them moving
 * together: the hover pulls the ink back to 90% on the button and both follow.
 * The same /90 every other solid control in here uses, and it lands the right
 * way round in both themes because the palette is achromatic — 90% of the ink is
 * 10% of the surface behind it, so light mode's dark shutter lifts toward the
 * bar and dark mode's near-white one settles into it.
 *
 * hoverFine, not hover: a touch device would otherwise latch the state on after
 * a tap and hold it there through the capture.
 *
 * **Recording is drawn achromatically**, which is the one place this departs
 * from every camera ever made. There is no red in this design to be coherent
 * with, so introducing one for a fifteen-second state would make it the loudest
 * thing in the app. Instead the ring — already present, already the camera body
 * — empties and refills as a progress track, and the fill becomes the stop
 * glyph. The elapsed time is legible in the viewfinder, where a camera puts it.
