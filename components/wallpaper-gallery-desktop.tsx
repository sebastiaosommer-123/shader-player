            In the chrome layer with the close and delete buttons rather than
            inside the card, and both halves of that are deliberate. The card is
            a projection node — Framer owns its transform for the length of the
            morph, and a plain child of one is scaled along with it. And this
            layer already fades in on `{ delay: 0.3, duration: 0.18 }`, which is
            the curve the bar wants anyway, so the whole of the gallery's chrome
            arrives as one thing instead of two.

            The price is this box, which mirrors the capture's own geometry so
            the bar lands on the picture and not on the letterbox: the wrapper's
            insets and `fitBox` are duplicated from the shared element above and
            have to be kept in step with it. */}
