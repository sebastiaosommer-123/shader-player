/**
 * Not one set of numbers for both bars: each track has to sit with whatever its
 * own bar puts beside it, and the two bars put different things there.
 *
 * The desktop track is 44 tall with 4px of inset, which puts its cells at 36. 44
 * is the desktop bar's one unit — the thumbnail slot and the shutter either side
 * of this are the same number (SLOT_SIZE in lib/toolbar-geometry.ts, and
 * SHUTTER_SIZES in shutter-button.tsx). That keeps the track's ends on the same
 * line as both, while the selected cell stays a step inside them — the tabs are
 * where you are, not the thing you came here to press. The three move together or
 * not at all: the bar is content-sized, so leaving one of them taller makes it
 * the bar's height and the other two float in the middle of it.
 *
 * Mobile keeps its cells at 40. It shares nothing with the desktop bar but this
 * component — that bar is sized for thumbs, and its own row has no slot or
 * shutter beside the track to line up with.
 *
 * The height is the fixed number in both shapes; only the width differs, and
 * what the cell holds is what decides it. A `pill` is `px-3` and comes out as
 * wide as the word inside it. A `circle` is `size-*`, the same number as the
 * height, which is what a numeral wants — it has no length to express. Neither
 * needs a radius of its own: the cell carries `rounded-full`, so a square box
 * *is* the circle.
 *
 * Both are on screen at once in the desktop bar, which is why this is the
 * caller's choice and not the component's: the shader track holds 01/02/03 and
 * the mode track beside it holds Image/Video.
 *
 * 13px in both, which is what the sliders and the sidebar are set at. The
 * numerals were a step above that when they were the only track in the app and
 * had nothing to be compared against; they have a track of words beside them
 * now, and one of the two being a pixel larger is a mismatch you can see.
 * Everything in the app is Space Mono 400 — size, case and tracking are the only
 * things that ever vary.
 *
 * They differ only between the cells: desktop butts them, mobile spaces them for
 * the touch targets.
 *
 * `cellHeight` is the pixel value of the cell class, and half of it is the
 * indicator's radius. Written out rather than left to `rounded-full` because of
 * the pill instances: there the indicator morphs *width* as well as position,
 * the cells not all being the same size, and Framer's layout projection
 * interpolates whatever number it is given — so a 9999px sentinel rides the
 * whole morph as an ellipse while the real radius stays a pill at both ends.
 * The circle instances only ever travel, so the value is merely correct for
 * them rather than load-bearing. Same lesson as SLOT_RADIUS in
 * lib/toolbar-geometry.ts. Keep it in step with the classes beside it.
